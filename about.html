      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <p>Hi! My name is Joseph Griffith and I'm currently a senior in high school.
          I love to code, program, and work with computers.
           I've taken many programming and IT-related courses and am actively taking more,
            such as Linux, Computer Systems, and Game Development.
             I am also a memeber of a winning team of the NASA Techrise challenge
             <a href="http://tooeleonline.com/blue-peak-engineers-win-nasa-challenge/"><u>News Article Link</u></a>.
              I'm open to and looking for any opportunities to learn and develop my skills.</p>

          <p>I was part of a team of high schoolers that was selected by NASA to send an expiriment to space.
            I Was our electronics/programminglead and eveltually team lead.
              I designed the circuitry and wrote the program that allowed us to manufacture composite materials in space.</p>
